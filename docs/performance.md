# Performance measurements - 2026-10-05

Performance is a current limitation, not a completed migration milestone. The user reported about22 FPS versus about60 in the retained build. A local packaged station02 spawn run reproduced about30 FPS at1920x1080 on the RTX3070/Vulkan adapter. The hosts use different texture mip limits (Bevy2048, retained512); neither a matched native benchmark nor144 FPS is established.

Optional `--profile` measures bounded CPU scopes after the first30 calls. It does not measure GPU execution or the entire render-thread cost. The same600-frame default-VSync scene before/after changed-collider query refresh and sampled reports measured:

| CPU scope | Before mean ms | After mean ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Fixed simulation, per15ms tick | 4.02 | 2.61 |
| Full diagnostics, per presentation | 1.39 | 0.022 |
| CPU mesh animation, per presentation | 5.79 | 5.75 |

Frame rate remained about30.2 versus30.6 FPS. A subsequent constant-pose upload fix plus `--uncapped` measured about35.1 FPS with animation4.63ms. This last run also changes presentation mode and is not an isolated FPS comparison for that fix. The remaining render/animation cost needs investigation. Do not infer a144 FPS ceiling or promise that this build reaches it.

Physics previously rebuilt the query tree twice every fixed step and marked unchanged poses as moved. It now incrementally refreshes actual changes;400 swept collision comparisons match full rebuilds across moves, rotations and visibility changes. Animated surfaces share rig samples, and constant poses no longer dirty/upload their meshes every frame. Full diagnostic snapshots are sampled every60 frames and refreshed for scripted/bounded capture completion and UI quit.

Reproduce with `launch-bevy.cmd --width 1920 --height 1080 --frames 600 --profile --report artifacts/performance.json`. Add `--uncapped` to request no-VSync presentation. Capture/JSON writes occur after shutdown. Current priorities are GPU upload/render-stage measurements, visible/PVS animation workload and a verified GPU skinning path. Preserve animation/eye/collision behavior when optimizing; do not lower fidelity silently to improve a benchmark.
