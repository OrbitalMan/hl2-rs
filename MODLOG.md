# HL2 reconstruction journal

## 2026-10-03: air crouch, stable contacts and pause/console

Air crouching now tucks the feet once while preserving head height and momentum; standing clearance gates air unducking. Reviewed retail sliding rules and analytical world-brush/convex sweeps correct reproduced wall-contact jump interruptions. Native PHY compound integration and full VPhysics parity remain unfinished.

Added a working resource-based pause menu and bounded developer console with cheat gates, history/editing/completion, position/angle commands and owned map loading. Focus freezes simulation and suppresses attack/jump leakage. The menu uses the owned title font and calibrated 720p metrics. Full console, save/options and paused audio remain open.

139 tests and strict Clippy pass; packaged weapon, movement and console fixtures pass their meaningful assertions. Latest double-door collision and secondary-ammo HUD reports are queued for the next iteration. Private bench PHY research matches the measured original standing height but is not integrated into Rust yet.

## 2026-10-03: publication and automatic empty fire

Published the reviewed Rust source to kvalls/hl2-rs with fresh-checkout instructions, contribution boundaries and a labeled runtime screenshot. The public main branch starts from a clean source snapshot; older local research history stays private. Windows formatting, Clippy and unit checks run for main pushes and contributor pull requests.

SMG1/AR2 now use a reviewed empty-fire latch and per-weapon half-second sound throttle. Empty clicks retain the primary deadline and animation; the next eligible attempt reloads, and idle reload uses a strictly elapsed primary deadline. Four regression tests cover held/released input, throttle boundaries, independent weapon state and reload completion. Other secondary attacks, autoswitch ranking and custom reload flags remain incomplete.

## 2026-10-03: depth, secondary fire and retail input/movement

Separated OpenGL depth testing and writes in the vendored backend, preserving depth clears between sky/world/viewmodel passes. Matching trainstation views reproduce then remove hidden light shafts, entrance columns and barrier effects; a front-side capture retains the visible columns.

Added shotgun alternate fire with twelve pellets/two shells, one-shell primary fallback, native/script-derived pump deadlines and retained secondary reload interruption. Accepted health/battery pickups now use their installed item sounds. The original engine confirms a six-to-four-shell alternate discharge.

Selection now consumes already-held attack buttons when Slot/Wheel opens the menu, rearms each button independently, and observes ordered script release/repress transitions. The F1 overlay identifies the Rust runtime. Movement now preserves standing/duck jump gravity ordering, categorizes after the sweep, crops diagonal boost, permits negative speed-cap additions and retains the native next-tick rising-air friction factor.

Fresh-clone build instructions and contribution boundaries were added for public source sharing. Game assets, native analysis, captures and research tools remain separate. Full campaign, NPC AI and Source rendering/collision parity remain unfinished; docs/validation.md records the checks and package fingerprint.

## 2026-10-02

The original executable remains read-only, with the earlier save/config snapshots preserved. Work is focused on HL2 fidelity; no FAL assets or crossovers were added.

The first prototype supported map/prop display. This iteration adds brush submodels, displacement/prop collision, fixed-step movement, timed entity I/O and doors, primary lightmap atlases, material transparency/tint/two-texture scrolling, compressed skeletal animation, PCM WAV audio, crowbar/pistol gameplay and limited scripted sequences/map transitions. These are partial implementations; the README lists the missing systems.

Mouse-look uses macroquad's previous-minus-current delta: upward movement increases pitch, rightward movement decreases Source yaw. The Windows miniquad reader additionally converts absolute RAWINPUT positions into deltas; treating those positions as motion caused extreme jumps during automation. Interactive verification is recorded in docs/validation.md.

Regression tests cover ordered/delayed duplicate outputs and fire limits, door locking/completion, shuffle batches, post-idle completion timing, ammunition transfer, stationary hull overlap at a floor, and disabling killed dynamic colliders. Movement and animation tests cover deterministic replay, acceleration/friction, jump apex and hierarchy/interpolation.

Research tools and private decompiler output belong in ../../work/hl2-decompiled. They are development references only. The runtime builds from Rust and reads owned assets in place. The packaged executable, rather than target/debug, is the final launch.cmd validation target.


### 2026-10-02: weapon selector, impacts and separate sky world

- Preserve nested sound-script wave alternatives; use distinct crowbar flesh/world sounds and hit animation.
- Add receiver-clipped installed impact textures and inherited surface-property bullet sounds. Marks follow rigid props and brush entities; keep a bounded local pool.
- Implement six-bucket UI with installed weapon icons, wheel cycling, confirmation, cancellation and previous-weapon switching; cancel reload on switch. Only crowbar and pistol combat are implemented.
- Separate background geometry/props using BSP leaf/PVS data and sky-camera scale. No native game code or decompiler tooling entered this project.
- Validation: 36/36 unit tests and workspace Clippy pass; packaged interactive run recorded three hit decals and multiple metal-impact sound variants with zero audio errors. Wheel UI rendered correctly; live confirmation needs a faster-input retest because its timeout expired between automation calls. Installed maps 78/79 parse with only the known empty coast map failure.

### 2026-10-02: retail HUD, six primary weapons and sky visibility

The earlier selector was a provisional design. This pass replaces it with installed resource dimensions, fonts/cell metrics, corners, labels and input behavior, checked against selected retail methods and a localized original-engine capture. Numeric HUD animation rules, bounded low-health loops and QuickInfo progress/fades/warning audio now run. Native GDI rasterization, damage messages and the remaining HUD panels/gates are still incomplete.

Added .357, SMG1, AR2 and shotgun primaries, separate ammo reserves, native/script-derived cadence/spread, shotgun shell/pump/interruption behavior and installed model sound events. Crowbar collision now tries the full ray, shortened +/-16 hull, facing test and closest corner refinement over approximate Rapier geometry. The background renderer now checks the camera BSP leaf's 3D-sky flag.

Validation: 79/79 workspace tests, strict Clippy, formatting and diff checks pass. Packaged input regression records 64 attacks, 82 impacts/marks, 6 model sound events, 199 audio requests, zero audio errors, two crowbar impact variants and one low-ammo warning. Actual Computer Use wheel/left/right/Q/Escape input verified selection with zero shots. A 60-frame hidden-sky test recorded zero sky frames. Installed maps remain 78/79, with the existing empty coast map rejected. See docs/validation.md for artifacts, current package fingerprint and limits.

Original-game research writes, localization copy, inspection tools and native pseudocode stay outside the Rust project. The original test process was closed, stock cfg manifest unchanged, no native DLL patched and no FAL/crossover used. Full NPC/campaign/shader fidelity remains substantial work; parser coverage is not campaign completion.

### LDR sky asset groundwork

Added a bounded six-face LDR sky loader resolving VMT base textures and transforms, with eight synthetic tests. HDR rendering, cube drawing and leaf gating integration remain unfinished. All 109 workspace tests and strict Clippy passed; the final package was rebuilt and smoke-tested.

### 2026-10-03: database audit, sky rendering and movement collision

Integrated the six-face LDR sky background with verified retail orientation, installed material transforms, clamped sampling and separate BSP 2D/3D eligibility. It draws before scenery/world without depth writes. Matched original-engine views corroborate cloud orientation; HDR, fog and sky polygon masks remain unfinished.

Player collision now excludes retained NPC-only world clip brushes, correcting the oversized invisible station-bench blockers. Grounded crouch commands and maximum speed are separated for jump boost; airborne crouch retains full air acceleration. Regression checks cover clip masks, duck boost caps, backward overspeed, air strafing and chained released jumps. Native PHY geometry and full movement equivalence remain open.

The supplied Database Method was tested privately across all exports. Unchanged gamedb misses functions and some boundaries/call targets, so an exact-byte catalogue keyed by module/address preserves the complete export inventory and known failures alongside the supplemental navigator. This improves traceability without marking semantic parity automatically. The original game also confirmed three-shell shotgun secondary behavior: double discharge leaves one shell, and the next secondary action fires it as a single shot. See research and validation for measured coverage and packaged checks.
